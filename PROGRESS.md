# Vex Language Implementation Progress

> **Project Goal**: Build a statically-typed functional programming language optimized for AI code generation and concurrent HTTP request handling that transpiles to Go
> **Dual Focus**: Designed specifically to be easily understood and generated by AI models while handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously
> **Timeline**: Personal learning project, developed for fun in spare time
> **Repository**: https://github.com/thsfranca/vex

## Phase 1: Parser Foundation âœ… **COMPLETED**

### What Was Built
- [x] ANTLR4 grammar for Vex syntax (`tools/grammar/Vex.g4`)
- [x] Multi-language parser generation (Go, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript)
- [x] Go parser successfully generated (`tools/gen/go/`)
- [x] Example Vex programs (`examples/`)
- [x] Project documentation and README
- [x] Implementation requirements document

### Key Achievements
- **Grammar supports**: S-expressions, arrays, symbols, strings, comments, nested structures
- **Working parsers**: Can parse valid Vex syntax into AST
- **Go integration**: Generated Go parser ready for next phase
- **Foundation set**: Clear roadmap and project structure

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose Go transpilation over other backend strategies for performance and concurrency
- Decided on static typing for performance, thread safety, and AI predictability
- Established Lisp-inspired S-expression syntax optimized for AI generation
- **AI-First Design**: Prioritized uniform syntax patterns over syntactic sugar
- **Concurrent HTTP Focus**: Specialized in handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously
- **Functional Immutability**: Thread-safe by design with immutable data structures
- **Goroutine Integration**: Each HTTP request runs in its own lightweight thread

## Phase 2: Basic Go Transpilation ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS**

### Goal
Generate executable Go code from Vex programs to achieve native performance, concurrent HTTP handling, and Go ecosystem access.

### âœ… Step 1: Basic Expression Transpilation **COMPLETED**
**What was built:**
- [x] Transpiler framework that converts AST to Go code
- [x] Basic value transpilation (numbers, strings, symbols)
- [x] Simple arithmetic expressions
- [x] Variable definitions
- [x] CLI tool for command-line transpilation
- [x] Integrated ANTLR parser with error handling
- [x] AST visitor pattern for code generation

**What was learned:**
- Code generation patterns
- AST traversal for transpilation
- Go code structure and syntax generation
- ANTLR parser integration

**Success Criteria:** âœ… **ACHIEVED**
```vex
42                ; Transpiles to: _ = 42
"hello"          ; Transpiles to: _ = "hello"
(+ 1 2)          ; Transpiles to: _ = 1 + 2
(def x 10)       ; Transpiles to: x := 10
```

### Working CLI Tool
```bash
go build -o fugo-transpiler cmd/fugo-transpiler/main.go
echo '(def result (+ 10 5))' > test.vex
./fugo-transpiler -input test.vex -output test.go
```

Generates:
```go
package main

func main() {
    result := 10 + 5
}
```

### ðŸš§ Step 2: Function Definitions and Calls **NEXT**
**What to build:**
- [ ] Function definition transpilation (`defn`)
- [ ] Function call generation
- [ ] Parameter and return value handling
- [ ] Basic Go package structure generation

**What will be learned:**
- Function signature mapping
- Go function syntax generation
- Package and import management

**Success Criteria:**
```vex
(defn add [x y] (+ x y))        ; Transpiles to: func add(x int, y int) int { return x + y }
(print (add 5 3))               ; Transpiles to: fmt.Println(add(5, 3))
```

### Current Architecture
- AST visitor pattern with code generation (`internal/transpiler/ast_visitor.go`)
- Separate code generator for Go syntax (`internal/transpiler/codegen.go`)
- ANTLR parser integration with error handling
- CLI tool for easy testing and development
