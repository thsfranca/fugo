## Phase 1: Parser Foundation âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Completed**: December 2024

### What Was Built
- [x] ANTLR4 grammar for Vex syntax (`tools/grammar/Vex.g4`)
- [x] Multi-language parser generation (Go, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript)
- [x] Go parser successfully generated (`tools/gen/go/`)
- [x] Example Vex programs (`examples/`)
- [x] Project documentation and README
- [x] Implementation requirements document

### Key Achievements
- **Grammar supports**: S-expressions, arrays, symbols, strings, comments, nested structures
- **Working parsers**: Can parse valid Vex syntax into AST
- **Go integration**: Generated Go parser ready for next phase
- **Foundation set**: Clear roadmap and project structure

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose Go transpilation over other backend strategies
- Decided on static typing for performance
- Established Lisp-inspired syntax with modern type annotations

---

## Phase 2: Go Transpilation Engine ðŸš§ **NEXT**

### Goal
Generate executable Go code from Vex programs to achieve native performance and Go ecosystem access.

### Step 1: Basic Expression Transpilation
**What you'll build:**
- [ ] Transpiler framework that converts AST to Go code
- [ ] Basic value transpilation (numbers, strings, symbols)
- [ ] Simple arithmetic expressions
- [ ] Variable definitions

**What you'll learn:**
- Code generation patterns
- AST traversal for transpilation
- Go code structure and syntax generation

**Success Criteria:**
```vex
42                ; Transpiles to: _ = 42
"hello"          ; Transpiles to: _ = "hello"
(+ 1 2)          ; Transpiles to: _ = 1 + 2
(def x 10)       ; Transpiles to: x := 10
```

### Step 2: Function Definitions and Calls
**What you'll build:**
- [ ] Function definition transpilation
- [ ] Function call generation
- [ ] Parameter and return value handling
- [ ] Basic Go package structure generation

**What you'll learn:**
- Function signature mapping
- Go function syntax generation
- Package and import management

**Success Criteria:**
```vex
(defn add [x y] (+ x y))        ; Transpiles to: func add(x int, y int) int { return x + y }
(print (add 5 3))               ; Transpiles to: fmt.Println(add(5, 3))
```

### Technical Notes
- Extending `VexListener` to become `VexEvaluator`
- Using Go's `interface{}` initially for values (optimize later)
- Simple map-based symbol table (enhance with scoping later)

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Check-ins
Update this section each week with:
- What was completed
- What was learned
- Challenges encountered
- Next week's focus

### Current Session - Refining Approach
**Status**: Starting Phase 2 (Go Transpilation)
**Focus**: Direct transpilation instead of interpreter
**Decision**: Skipping tree-walking interpreter to align with transpilation goals
**Next**: Basic expression transpiler framework

---

## Future Phases (Planned)

### Phase 3: Type System Integration
**What you'll build:**
- Basic type annotations in function signatures
- Type checking during transpilation
- Go type mapping (Vex types â†’ Go types)

### Phase 4: Advanced Transpilation Features
**What you'll build:**
- Go interop (calling Go functions from Vex)
- Optimized code generation
- Error handling and propagation

### Phase 5: Immutable Data Structures
- Persistent vectors and maps
- Structural sharing implementation
- Functional programming primitives

### Phase 6: Standard Library & HTTP Framework
- HTTP service primitives
- Database integration helpers
- JSON processing and APIs

### Phase 7: IDE Support & Tooling
- Language Server Protocol implementation
- Syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- Debugging support with source maps

### Phase 8: Performance & Production Features
- Advanced optimizations
- Benchmarking and profiling
- Deployment tooling
