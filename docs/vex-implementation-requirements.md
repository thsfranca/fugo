# Vex Language Implementation Requirements

## Overview

Vex is a statically-typed functional programming language designed specifically for **AI code generation** and high-performance backend services. The language transpiles to Go to achieve maximum performance while maintaining excellent Go ecosystem interoperability and providing uniform, predictable syntax patterns that AI models can reliably understand and generate. This document outlines the complete implementation roadmap.

## Core Design Principles

**ðŸ¤– AI-First Design**: Every language feature must be optimized for AI code generation. Uniform S-expression syntax, predictable patterns, and semantic clarity take priority over syntactic convenience.

**ðŸŽ¯ Concurrent HTTP Specialization**: Language features specifically designed for handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously, JWT authentication, and scalable web API development - the most market-valuable use cases.

**âš¡ Concurrent Performance First**: Every design decision must prioritize runtime performance and scalability for backend services handling thousands of simultaneous HTTP requests using Go's goroutines.

**ðŸ”’ Static Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking prevents runtime errors and enables aggressive optimization through Go transpilation.

**ðŸ”— Go Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless interoperability with existing Go libraries, frameworks, and infrastructure.

**ðŸ§© Functional Programming**: Immutable data structures, pure functions, and functional composition as primary paradigms that AI can reliably generate and that provide thread-safety for concurrent HTTP handling.

### AI-Friendly Design Goals

**Uniform Syntax**: S-expressions provide consistent `(operation args...)` structure with no precedence rules or special cases.

**Semantic Clarity**: Function names and operations clearly express intent, making AI generation more reliable.

**Composable Patterns**: Simple building blocks that AI can combine into complex systems.

**Predictable Structure**: Consistent patterns that AI models can learn once and apply everywhere.

**Minimal Cognitive Load**: Fewer syntax rules mean AI can focus on business logic rather than parsing complexity, while immutable-by-default design eliminates concurrency complexity.

### Concurrent HTTP Design Goals

**Thread-Safe by Default**: Immutable data structures eliminate the possibility of race conditions when handling multiple simultaneous requests.

**Goroutine-Per-Request**: Each HTTP request automatically runs in its own lightweight Go goroutine, enabling thousands of concurrent connections.

**Stateless Patterns**: Functional design naturally supports stateless request handling, essential for horizontal scaling.

**Non-Blocking Operations**: Built-in async patterns for database calls, HTTP requests, and I/O operations.

**Resource Management**: Automatic connection pooling, request timeouts, and resource cleanup.

## Phase 1: Core Type System Implementation

### Type System Foundation

**Primitive Types**
- `int`: 64-bit signed integers mapping to Go's `int64`
- `float`: 64-bit floating point mapping to Go's `float64`
- `string`: UTF-8 strings mapping to Go's `string`
- `symbol`: Immutable identifiers for functions and values, similar to Clojure symbols
- `bool`: Boolean values mapping to Go's `bool`

**Collection Types**
- `[T]`: Homogeneous lists with structural sharing for immutability
- `{K: V}`: Immutable maps with efficient copy-on-write semantics

**Type Inference Engine**
Complete Hindley-Milner style type inference to minimize explicit type annotations while maintaining static guarantees. The inference engine must handle:
- Function parameter and return type deduction
- Generic type parameter inference
- Collection element type inference
- Cross-function type propagation

**Type Checker Architecture**
Multi-pass type checking system that validates:
- Type compatibility in expressions
- Function signature matching
- Collection homogeneity
- Immutability constraints
- Go interop type safety

### Symbol System Design

Symbols serve as first-class identifiers that can reference functions, variables, or type constructors. Unlike strings, symbols are interned and compared by identity rather than content. Symbol resolution must support:
- Namespace-qualified symbols for module system
- Dynamic symbol creation for metaprogramming
- Efficient symbol table lookup for transpilation
- Go function binding through symbol mapping

## Phase 2: Language Syntax and Grammar Extension

### Enhanced Grammar Definition

Extend the existing ANTLR grammar to support:
- Type annotations in function signatures and variable declarations
- Pattern matching expressions for destructuring
- Lambda expressions with capture semantics
- Module import and export declarations
- Go interop syntax for calling Go functions

**Function Definition Syntax**
```vex
(defn function-name [param1: Type1 param2: Type2] -> ReturnType
  body-expressions)
```

**Type Declaration Syntax**
```vex
(deftype TypeName {field1: Type1 field2: Type2})
```

**Pattern Matching Syntax**
```vex
(match expression
  pattern1 -> result1
  pattern2 -> result2)
```

### Module System Architecture

Design a module system that supports:
- Explicit imports and exports for dependency management
- Namespace isolation to prevent symbol conflicts
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Go package mapping for seamless interoperability

## Phase 3: Go Transpilation Engine

### Transpiler Architecture

**Multi-Stage Compilation Pipeline**
1. Parse Vex source into AST using existing ANTLR parser
2. Perform semantic analysis and type checking
3. Transform AST into typed intermediate representation
4. Generate idiomatic Go code with optimal type usage
5. Emit Go package structure with proper imports

**Code Generation Strategy**
The transpiler must generate Go code that:
- Uses concrete types instead of `interface{}` wherever possible
- Leverages Go's struct types for Vex records
- Maps Vex functions to Go functions with matching signatures
- Implements immutable collections using persistent data structures
- Generates efficient iteration patterns for collection operations

**Memory Management**
Since Go handles garbage collection, the transpiler should:
- Minimize allocation through value reuse
- Generate code that works efficiently with Go's GC
- Use object pooling for high-frequency allocations
- Implement structural sharing for immutable collections

### Go Interoperability Layer

**Function Binding System**
Create a mechanism to expose Go functions to Vex code through:
- Automatic type conversion between Vex and Go types
- Error handling integration using Go's error interface
- Goroutine management for concurrent operations
- Context propagation for request scoping

**Standard Library Integration**
Map common Go standard library packages to Vex functions:
- HTTP handling through net/http integration
- JSON processing with encoding/json
- Database operations via database/sql
- Logging using structured logging libraries

## Phase 4: Immutable Data Structures

### Persistent Collection Implementation

**List Implementation**
Implement persistent vectors using bit-partitioned vector tries for:
- O(log32 N) access, update, and append operations
- Structural sharing to minimize memory overhead
- Efficient iteration and transformation operations
- Thread-safe access patterns for concurrent use

**Map Implementation**
Implement hash array mapped tries (HAMT) for persistent maps with:
- O(log32 N) lookup, insertion, and deletion
- Structural sharing for memory efficiency
- Ordered iteration support for deterministic behavior
- Integration with Go's map syntax where possible

**Optimization Strategies**
- Use transients for bulk operations to improve performance
- Implement lazy evaluation for collection transformations
- Cache hash codes for map keys to avoid recomputation
- Use bit manipulation tricks for efficient tree traversal

## Phase 5: Concurrency and Backend Service Features

### Concurrency Model

**Goroutine Integration**
Design Vex concurrency primitives that map to Go goroutines:
- Lightweight process spawning with isolated state
- Channel-based communication for message passing
