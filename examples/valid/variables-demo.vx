; Variable Definition Demo
; This shows variable definitions that would be used in a real program
; (Currently the transpiler doesn't track usage, so this generates unused vars)

; Basic variable definition
(def pi 3.14159)

; String variable
(def greeting "Hello")

; Computed values
(def area (* pi 5))
(def doubled (+ pi pi))

; This would need usage tracking or function definitions to be valid Go
