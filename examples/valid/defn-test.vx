;; Test the defn macro implementation
;; First define the defn macro
(macro defn [name params body]
  (def ~name (fn ~params ~body)))

;; Now use defn to define functions
(defn add [x y]
  (+ x y))

(defn greet [name]
  (.WriteString "Hello " name))

;; Test that defn works by calling the functions
(add 5 3)
(greet "World")
