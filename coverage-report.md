### 🔧 How to Improve Coverage:
1. **Run coverage locally:** `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out`
2. **Add tests for uncovered code paths**
3. **Focus on critical functionality first**
4. **Consider edge cases and error conditions**

This helps maintain code quality and catch potential bugs early!
