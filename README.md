A statically-typed functional programming language that transpiles to Go, designed for AI code generation and concurrent HTTP request handling, while exploring language implementation concepts and functional programming paradigms.

## Overview

Vex is an experimental programming language that combines functional programming principles with static typing, inspired by Lisp syntax and **specifically designed to be easily generated by AI models while handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously**. It transpiles to Go for maximum performance and leverages S-expression syntax to create predictable, uniform code patterns that AI can reliably understand and generate for concurrent web services.

This is a **study project created for educational purposes and fun** - exploring how language design can optimize for AI code generation while building a complete language implementation from scratch.

### 🤖 **AI-First + Concurrent HTTP Design Philosophy**

Vex is designed with two primary goals:

**🧠 AI Code Generation**:
- **Uniform S-expression syntax**: Everything follows `(operation args...)` pattern, eliminating precedence rules and syntax complexity
- **Predictable structure**: Consistent patterns that AI models can learn and replicate reliably  
- **Semantic clarity**: Function names and operations clearly express intent
- **Composable building blocks**: Simple operations that combine into complex functionality
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Fewer syntax rules mean AI can focus on logic rather than parsing edge cases

**⚡ Concurrent HTTP Performance**:
- **Goroutine-based concurrency**: Each HTTP request runs in its own lightweight thread
- **Functional immutability**: Thread-safe by design with immutable data structures
- **Go's performance**: Direct transpilation to Go for native concurrency and speed
- **Stateless patterns**: Functional design naturally supports concurrent request handling
- **Built-in HTTP patterns**: Language constructs optimized for web service development

## Language Vision

Vex aims to be a functional programming language optimized for AI generation and concurrent HTTP handling with:

- **AI-friendly syntax**: S-expressions provide uniform, predictable structure for AI models
- **Thread-safe by design**: Functional immutability means every program safely handles concurrent requests
- **Static typing** with type inference for performance and thread safety  
- **Semantic annotations**: Built-in metadata to guide AI code generation
- **Go transpilation** for native performance, concurrency, and ecosystem access
- **HTTP service focus** with built-in patterns for scalable web APIs and authentication
- **Composable patterns**: Simple building blocks that AI can combine into scalable solutions

### 🎯 **Perfect for AI Code Generation + Concurrent HTTP**

Vex's design makes it ideal for AI-assisted development of concurrent web services:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP handlers that are naturally concurrent:
(defn api-endpoint [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-input)
      (process-data)            ; Always thread-safe by design
      (format-response)))

;; AI can generate HTTP servers that handle thousands of requests:
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/users" get-users)    ; Each request runs in its own goroutine
    (POST "/data" process-data) ; Thread-safe through immutable design
  ])
```

The uniform S-expression structure + functional design means AI models can:
- **Learn patterns quickly**: Same structure for all operations
- **Generate thread-safe code automatically**: Immutable data = no concurrency bugs
- **Scale automatically**: Every program handles thousands of concurrent requests
- **Focus on logic**: No syntax complexity, no concurrency complexity

### Current Status: Advanced Transpiler with Type System ✅

The project currently includes:
- **ANTLR4 grammar** for S-expressions, arrays, symbols, strings, and advanced language constructs
- **Advanced transpiler** with multi-phase compilation pipeline
- **CLI tool** (`vex`) with `transpile` and `run` commands
- **Advanced language features**:
  - Variable definitions: `(def x 10)` → `x := 10`
  - Arithmetic expressions: `(+ 1 2)` → `1 + 2`
  - Import system: `(import "fmt")` → `import "fmt"`
  - Macro system with user-defined macros
  - Semantic analysis with type checking and inference
  - Symbol resolution and namespace management
  - Type-aware code generation
- **Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline** with automated quality checks
- **Automated release process** with PR label-based version management  
- **Grammar validation system** testing both valid and invalid syntax
- **VSCode extension** with syntax highlighting and language support
- **Example programs** demonstrating working features

### Working Today 🚀

You can transpile and run Vex programs:

```bash
# Build the transpiler
go build -o vex cmd/fugo-transpiler/main.go

# Transpile to Go
echo '(def x (+ 5 3))' > example.vex
./vex transpile -input example.vex -output example.go

# Or transpile and run directly
./vex run -input example.vex
```

Outputs valid Go code:
```go
package main

func main() {
    x := 5 + 3
}
```

Advanced features working:
```vex
;; Import Go packages
(import "fmt")

;; Define variables with complex expressions
(def result (+ (* 10 5) (- 20 5)))

;; Macro definitions
(macro debug-print [value] (fmt/Println "DEBUG:" value))

;; Call Go functions
(fmt/Println "Hello from Vex!")
```

### Next Phase 🚧

- **Function definitions** (`defn`) for user-defined functions
- **AI-friendly HTTP patterns** with semantic annotations for endpoints
- **HTTP server framework** that AI can generate from simple descriptions
- **JWT authentication patterns** as the most market-valuable auth method
- **Immutable data structures** with structural sharing
- **Standard library** for common operations

Note: Type system with inference and checking is already implemented.

### Example Vex Code (Vision)

Here's what AI-friendly Vex programs might look like when fully implemented:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP endpoints that are inherently thread-safe
(defn get-user-profile
  ^{:http-endpoint "/api/users/:id"
    :method "GET"
    :auth-required true
    :returns "application/json"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (extract-user-id)
      (fetch-user-from-db)         ; Always non-blocking
      (format-json-response)))

;; AI generates authentication that naturally handles thousands of logins
(defn login-endpoint
  ^{:purpose "authenticate-user"
    :security "high"
    :returns "jwt-token"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-credentials)
      (create-jwt-token)
      (json-response)))

;; AI composes systems that automatically scale to handle any load
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/api/users" list-users :jwt-auth)      ; Scales to millions of requests
    (POST "/api/login" login-endpoint)           ; Thread-safe by design
    (PUT "/api/users/:id" update-user :jwt-auth) ; No concurrency complexity
  ])
```

**Why AI-generated Vex code is naturally scalable:**
- **Uniform structure**: Everything is `(operation args...)` - always thread-safe
- **Immutable by default**: No shared mutable state = impossible to have concurrency bugs
- **Functional composition**: `(-> data transform1 transform2)` is inherently thread-safe
- **One pattern**: AI learns simple patterns that automatically scale
- **Go's goroutines**: Every AI-generated program scales to millions of requests

## Grammar Rules

The main grammar rules are:

- `program`: The root rule, matches one or more lists followed by EOF
- `list`: Matches `(` followed by elements followed by `)`
- `array`: Matches `[` followed by elements followed by `]`
- Elements can be: arrays, lists, symbols, or strings
- Supports arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and other symbols

## Learning Goals

## Release Process

Vex uses an automated release system triggered by PR labels:

- **`release:patch`** - Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **`release:minor`** - New features and enhancements  
- **`release:major`** - Breaking changes

When a PR with a release label is merged to `main`, the system automatically:
1. Bumps the version number
2. Creates a Git tag
3. Generates release notes
4. Updates the changelog

See [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md) for detailed information.

## Contributing

This is a personal study project, but feel free to:
- Test the grammar validation system
- Suggest language design ideas
- Report issues with the grammar or tooling
- Fork for your own experiments
- Try the editor support tools

**Note**: This is an educational project for learning compiler/language implementation concepts. It's not intended for production use - just for the joy of building a programming language from scratch!
