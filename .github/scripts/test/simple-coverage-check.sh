### üîß How to Improve Coverage:
1. **Run coverage locally:** \`go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out\`
2. **Add tests for uncovered code paths**
3. **Focus on critical functionality first**
4. **Consider edge cases and error conditions**

This helps maintain code quality and catch potential bugs early!"
